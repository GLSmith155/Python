Future Plans:

1. Social Media implementation:
    a. Making parts of the site sharable to popular social media. Might be as simple as just being able to quick share that they are 'active on thrivelog.'
    b. Implementing a new fullstack function that enables users to both see and communicate with one another if they so choose to be publicly visible, but the default 
    should be private. In fact if I go a more 'forum' route with this task then it would be fairly easy. I want to research this more before committing to it, as it
    should be actually userful and/or motivating rather than just simply functional.
    
2. Python API of quotes.   Deadline for complete functionality: 12/27/2021
    a. For both this project and future projects I wish that there were an api of quotes that allows users to customize what type of quotes they receive. I plan to incorporate as 
    many philosophies, religions, and inspiring individuals as possible to the point where just about anyone could find something motivating for them. We all want to do better, 
    but I believe there is no better way to motivate people than to reach them within their own paradigms and meet them where they're at. Nevertheless this project will be more
    time consuming than anything, and as such I will give myself a longer deadline.
